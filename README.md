# GNU-Linux_AsmEnvironment

A basic assembly environment for GNU-Linux systems. This project is meant for didactic purpose, it's not intended for any professional applications.
It was based on my other project "PCx86_baremetal".

I'm not a professional developer. I made these codes just for fun. Don't expect professional performance from them.
